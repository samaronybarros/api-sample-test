## Improvement

I would improve this project by first refactoring the code to separate concerns: each integration (companies, contacts, meetings) could be moved into its own module so that the logic isn't all in one large file.

I'd add proper error handling and logging to make debugging easier and to avoid process crashes.


I would also introduce unit tests to cover the functionality and edge cases.

In terms of performance, batching API requests (as demonstrated for associations and contact details) is key; I'd further explore rate limiting and parallelizing requests where possible. I'd also consider using a more robust queue system or a job manager instead of the 'async.queue' for production load.

Enhancing code readability by adopting consistent naming conventions and adding inline comments would help maintainability.

Finally, I would integrate a configuration manager to handle API endpoints and credentials rather than hardcoding values, thereby improving security and flexibility.

## Bug fixes

### Wrong operator
there was a wrong operator in the code. It must be GTE instead of GTQ

```js
// Before
{ propertyName, operator: 'GTQ', value: `${date.valueOf()}` },

// After
{ propertyName, operator: 'GTE', value: `${date.valueOf()}` },
```
